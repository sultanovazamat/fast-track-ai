## **Repository Structure**

### ðŸ“‚ **Project Directory**
- **Part I: Methodology**  
  The `project` directory contains all the resources and code referenced in the first part of the book. This section focuses on step-by-step guidance for creating a fully functional AI application, starting from research and ending with deployment.

### ðŸ““ **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Part II: Ready-to-Go AI Solutions**  
  The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing various prototypes for real-life AI applications. These examples cover:
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Sentiment analysis, text classification, and more.
  - **Computer Vision (CV)**: Object detection, pose estimation, and other use cases.

Each notebook includes theoretical explanations and code that you can refine and deploy using the methodology from Part I.
